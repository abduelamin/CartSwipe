## Learning Experience

Developing CartSwipe was a valuable learning experience for me as a frontend developer. Here are some key takeaways:

- **Enhancing React Skills:** Working extensively with React.js allowed me to deepen my understanding of component-based architecture and state management techniques using hooks and context API.
- **Form Validation:** Implementing form validation using React Hook Form and Zod helped me learn best practices for handling user input and ensuring data integrity.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Integrating JWT for user authentication and protecting API endpoints enhanced my knowledge of security practices in web development.
- **Handling Asynchronous Operations:** Dealing with asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from the backend and updating the UI accordingly, taught me how to manage state effectively and handle loading and error states gracefully.
- **Code Organization:** Utilizing utility functions and modularizing code helped me maintain a clean and organized codebase, making it easier to debug and refactor as needed.

## Future Iterations

In future iterations, I plan to add the following enhancements to CartSwipe:

- **Stripe Integration:** Implementing Stripe payment gateway to enable secure and seamless online transactions.
- **Improved User Experience:** Enhancing the user interface and adding features such as product reviews, wishlists, and order tracking to provide a more immersive shopping experience.
